# ext-to-language

A simple library that maps extensions to languages. Graphite (graphite.dev) uses this library to transform raw file paths to languages when choosing what syntax highlighting to use.

If you use Graphite for code review and wish that a file type mapped to a specific language when highlighting diffs, please feel free to create a pull request here.
